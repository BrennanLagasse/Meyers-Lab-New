Code Goals:
  1. Import data from Two-Photon Calcium Imaging behavioral experiments conducted by the Allen Institute and convert it to a rastered format for the NeuroDecodeR toolkit
  2. Convert the data from MATLAB to R
  3. Analyze the propogation of information in the brain using the NeuroDecodeR Toolkit
  
Important Files:
  * Rastering: convertOphysToRaster.m is the function for converting an ophys session into raster format, and it is implemented by ophysToRasterTest.m
  * Conversion to R: convertOphysToR.R
  * Analysis: ophys_analysis.Rmd, ephys_analysis.Rmd
